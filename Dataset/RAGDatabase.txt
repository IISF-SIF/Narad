Bhuvan NOEDA Data Products - Terrestrial Sciences Products - Annual Cropland Data set - https://bhuvan-app3.nrsc.gov.in/data/download/index.php?c=p&s=NICES&p=acd&g=TS - The annual cropland products were the integrated outcome of the Land use land cover (LULC) output generated at 56m resolution under National Level LULC mapping on 1: 2,50,000 scale using multi-temporal AWiFS project. The study involved use of multi temporal AWiFS data covering Kharif (Aug –Nov), Rabi (Jan- Mar), Zaid (April- May) seasons to address spatial and temporal variability in cropping pattern and other land cover classes. The technical document can be found at https://bhuvan-app3.nrsc.gov.in/data/download/tools/document/crop_land.pdf .
Bhuvan NOEDA Data Products - Terrestrial Sciences Products - AWiFS: Snow Albedo - https://bhuvan-app3.nrsc.gov.in/data/download/index.php?c=p&s=NICES&p=salbedo&g=TS - Broad band Snow albedo is an important geophysical parameter for studies related to weather, climate, and hydrometeorology and so on. Snow has the highest albedo in nature and hence has a significant influence on surface energy budget and on Earth's radiative balance.

Bhuvan NOEDA Data Products - Terrestrial Sciences Products - AWiFS: Water Bodies Fraction - https://bhuvan-app3.nrsc.gov.in/data/download/index.php?c=p&s=NICES&g=TS&p=wbf - Water Bodies consists of all surface water bodies viz. reservoirs, irrigation tanks, lakes, ponds, and rivers / streams. The area under water bodies is dynamic in natures and hence multi-temporal satellite data was used for monitoring. An automated extraction algorithm developed is used for quick processing of satellite data acquired from Resourcesat -1, Resourcesat-2 AWiFS sensors (56m spatial resolution) which enables the generation of water body layer.
